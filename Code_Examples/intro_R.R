##### An introduction to programming in R


### 1. Sign up to RStudio Cloud
### 2. Set up a project using the Github repo.


## This is an R script.
## You can write code here.
## To run a line of code
## - Press Ctrl/Cmd + Enter and the line
## your cursor is on will run
## Can also highlight multiple lines and run them.
## Can also type directly into the console.

#### Task 1 ####

## Let's find out how to take the log of a real number in R.
## Try get help on what functions R has for this by running
?log
## Compute the log of 12 to the base 4 and 27 to the base 3

#### Task 4 ####
## store your answers to the previous question in two objects,
## calling them x and y
## what is the result from running the below line
